## Project Overview

In this project, we explore Uber ride data to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we aim to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. This analysis can help stakeholders understand patterns, trends, and anomalies in Uber rides.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/jahanra02/uber_data_analysis/releases). You will find the necessary files there to execute the analysis.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

### Installation

You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jahanra02/uber_data_analysis.git
```

Then navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd uber_data_analysis
```

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from publicly available Uber datasets. These datasets include ride details such as pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, and fare amounts. The datasets are rich in information, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of Uber rides.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive computing and sharing results.
- **Google Colab**: An alternative for running Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.
